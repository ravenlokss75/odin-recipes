# odin-recipes
basic recipe website Odin Student

I am making my first website using the odin project. this will be some recipes put together. i will have dimanstrated my use of git and git hub, as well as how to use p to make paragraphes, strong to make text bold and em to make text italic and br to make breaks to my text. I will also be learning to use relitave and absolute links in this site and use img to place images in my website.
