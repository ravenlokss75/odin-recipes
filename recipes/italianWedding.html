<p>These Italian wedding cookies are sometimes called Mexican wedding cookies or butterballs and can be shaped into crescents. They're also delicious made with pecans or hazelnuts instead of almonds. Great for gifting! This recipe was given to me by a friend who grew up in central Europe; they are the best wedding cookies I've ever had. Italian wedding cookies are balls of buttery goodness rolled in powdered sugar. What's not to love?</p>
